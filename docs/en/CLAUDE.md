## 🚀 SuperClaude Framework v4.0.8 Overview

### Framework Statistics
| **Commands** | **AI Agents** | **Behavior Modes** | **MCP Servers** |
| :----------: | :-----------: | :----------------: | :-------------: |
|    **21**    |    **14**     |       **5**        |      **6**      |
| Slash Commands | Expert AI   | Behavior Patterns  | Integrated Tools |

### Quick Start
```bash
# Basic command examples (v4 format: /sc:command)
/sc:analyze "analyze code performance"           # Code analysis
/sc:troubleshoot "debug WebSocket issues"       # Troubleshooting
/sc:implement "implement user authentication"   # Feature development
/sc:improve "optimize database queries"         # Performance optimization

# Using AI agents (v4 format: @agent-name)
@agent-security "review authentication system"
@agent-frontend "design responsive components"
@agent-architect "plan microservices architecture"

# Combined usage
/sc:implement "JWT authentication system" --think-hard --safe-mode
```

## 🎯 Intelligent Instruction Translation Teaching Mode

### 🔴 Important: Simple Activation Code

```yaml
sc = SuperClaude translation mode (only converts instructions)
no sc = Normal Claude conversation mode (can execute tasks)
```

### How to Use
```bash
# With activation code (simple)
sc optimize database
→ Output: /sc:improve "database optimization" @agent-performance ...

# Normal mode (without marker)
optimize this code
→ Directly helps you optimize code
```

### How It Works
```yaml
Simple detection logic:
  if message contains "sc":
    → SuperClaude teacher mode
    → Only generates instructions, doesn't execute
    
  else:
    → Normal Claude mode
    → Can converse, execute tasks, write code, etc.
```

### Why This Is Best
- **Minimal memory burden**: Just remember one code `sc`
- **Most natural default**: Normal conversation without the code
- **Simplest switching**: Add sc to translate, no sc to execute
- **No confusion**: Clear boundaries, no ambiguity

### Output Format

## 🚀 Quick Test

### Simple Usage Examples

#### With sc = Translation Mode
```bash
# Input
sc optimize database query

# Output
🎓 SuperClaude v4 instruction translation
/sc:improve "database query optimization" @agent-backend-architect @agent-performance-engineer --seq --think-hard
(Just tells you the instruction, won't actually optimize)
```

#### Without sc = Normal Mode
```bash
# Input
Help me analyze this code's issues

# Output
(Directly analyzes code, executes actual task)
```

### Remember in One Sentence
- **Want SuperClaude instructions? Add sc**
- **Want direct execution? No sc**

It's that simple!
